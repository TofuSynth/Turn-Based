### Tl;Dr

Templating can run into confusion when you're trying to use a generic type to call a certain function that the type may or may not actually possess. By using constraints, we can tell the compiler, "we're only going to accept types that extend from this base class, or implement this interface, or types that are structs, or types that are classes, etc." and so the compiler can understand what is in line with the programmer's intent, and what is not.

### More in-depth

Generics give us a ton of freedom, but there are situations where the compiler needs to know *roughly* what kinds of types we're talking about. **For example, this would throw an error**. The top section is setup, the error occurs at the bottom.

```csharp
//An interface that can be implemented by anything with a public "Unlock" method
public interface ILockable {
	void Unlock();
}

public class Door : ILockable {
	private bool isLocked = true;
	
	public void Unlock()
	{
		isLocked = false;
		OpenDoor();
	}

	public void OpenDoor()
	{
		//some logic to move character from one side of door to the other
	}
}

public class Chest : IOpenable {
	private bool isLocked = true;
	
	public void Unlock()
	{
		isLocked = false;
		OpenInventory();
	}

	public void OpenInventory()
	{
		//some logic to show inventory screen of the contents of the chest
	}
}

public class Key {
	public void Use<T>(T target)
	{
		target.Unlock(); //this throws an error, becuase there's no reason for the compiler to assume the target has an Unlock function. Maybe we're giving it an int, or a character.
	}
}
```

It can however be corrected with a constraint that requires `T` be a type that implements `ILockable`

```csharp
public class Key {
	public void Use<T>(T target) where T : ILockable
	{
		target.Unlock(); //because of the constraint, the compiler knows target has an Unlock() function
	}
}
```

There are a handful of different kinds of constraints (requiring things to be classes, structs, nullable, implementing a certain interface or base class, and some others), but it's not something I've bothered to memorize, and nor should you. When it comes time to need a constraint, I usually just google "c# constraints" which takes me to this page: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/generics/constraints-on-type-parameters

Microsoft's docs are harder to process than Unity's (which means they're awful), but there's a table on that page which shows every constraint and what it does.
